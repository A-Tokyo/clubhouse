// NOTE: manually get the SMS verification code

await clubhouse.completePhoneNumberAuth(
  examplePhoneNumber,
  exampleVerificationCode
)

// you should now be authenticated with a userId and authToken

const me = await clubhouse.getMe()

const profile = await clubhouse.getProfile(exampleUserId)

// get a single page of users that our example user is following
const following = await clubhouse.getFollowing(exampleUserId)

// get a single page of users who are following our example user
const followers = await clubhouse.getFollowers(exampleUserId)

// get all of the users that our example user is following
// (this will attempt to fetch all of the page results)
const allFollowing = await clubhouse.getAllFollowing(exampleUserId)

// get all of the users following our example user
// (this will attempt to fetch all of the page results)
const allFollowers = await clubhouse.getAllFollowers(exampleUserId)
